# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## About Me
Im a 15 year old coder from England.<br/>
I first got into programming when i was playing Minetest(https://github.com/minetest/minetest), which is an open source sandbox game and i wanted to learn how to mod it, which is done in Lua.<br/>
Im currently learning Golang i hope to have alot of fun with it but also to make useful programs<br/>
